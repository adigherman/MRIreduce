\title{Process T1-weighted Brain MRI Data with FSL and Register to EVE Atlas}
\usage{
eve_T1(
  fpath,
  outpath,
  fsl_path = "/Users/jinyaotian/fsl",
  fsl_outputtype = "NIFTI_GZ"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fpath}{Character string specifying the path to one T1-weighted MRI file. The file should be in NIFTI file format (.nii.gz).}

\item{outpath}{Character string specifying the output directory where the results
will be saved as an Rdata file.}

\item{fsl_path}{Character string specifying the directory where FSL is installed.}

\item{fsl_outputtype}{Character string specifying the FSL output file type.
Defaults to "NIFTI_GZ".}
}
\value{
Saves the image data after processing to the specified output path.
Outputs an Rdata file containing three components: image intensities array,
segmented tissues array, and brain volume metrics.

\description{
This function takes a T1-weighted brain MRI image, performs bias correction,
reorientation to standard space, brain extraction using FSL's BET, and registration
to the EVE brain template. It then segments the brain volume into different tissue
types, calculates intracranial volume and outputs the results as an Rdata file.
}
\details{
The function begins by loading the EVE brain template for image registration. It then reads the
T1-weighted MRI file and reorients it to standard space using FSL's \code{fslreorient2std}.
Following reorientation, it applies bias correction with FSL's \code{fsl_biascorrect}, which
is necessary to correct for field inhomogeneities that can affect quantitative analysis.
The next step involves using FSLâ€™s Brain Extraction Tool (BET) to isolate the brain from
non-brain tissue which is crucial for accurate subsequent analysis.
After brain extraction, the image is registered to the EVE brain atlas using FLIRT,
ensuring that the image is aligned with a standard coordinate space for comparable
anatomical analysis. Subsequent to registration, the function uses FSL's FAST tool to
segment the brain into white matter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, which
are essential for studying brain structure and pathology. Finally, it calculates the
volume of these tissues, providing key data points for clinical and research applications.
Each step logs its progress with timestamps, aiding in debugging and optimization of processing times.
